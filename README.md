# Mapping_Earthquakes
module 13 

## Overview 

In this module we used our javascript skills to create an interactive map that shows where earthquakes have occured. We created an API call to gather the earquake data to pull into our map. We built in lines to show on the map where the tectonic plates lie to see how close earthquakes were to those lines. The different colored dots on the map represent the different earthquakes. 

We created a javascript function to color the dots by severity of the earthquake, red being the biggest earthquakes with a magnitude  greater than 6 , orange with a madnitude greater than 5 and yellow being anything less than 5. We also createde a popup where you can click on the earthquake dot and it will tell you the exact magnitude and location of the earthquake. There are also differnt layers to the map. 

In the upper right hand corner you can change the layout of the map to sattelle, streets or light view. You can also remove and add the tectonic plate lines, earthquake markers and major earthquake markers, you can even mix and match and choose only major earthquake markers and tectnoic plate lines or whatever you would like to see. Below is an image of the interactive map!
